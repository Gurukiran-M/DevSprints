              In the spring of 2023, four visionary individuals, Abhinav Bhatt,
              Dileep Raj, Gurukiran M, and Dipesh, embarked on a journey that
              would forever change the trajectory of our lives and the lives of
              countless others. United by a shared purpose and fueled by our
              passion for positive change, these four second-year engineering
              students came together to give birth to NourishUnity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Inspired by the spirit of unity and the call to action set forth
              by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger,
              we conceived NourishUnity as a platform to address a fundamental
              challenge that resonated deeply with each of us. With a collective
              commitment to eradicating hunger, fostering sustainable
              agricultural practices, and creating lasting impact, NourishUnity
              was established.
              <br />
              <br />And with a goal of making the world a better place, the idea
              for <span style="font-weight: bold">NourishUnity</span> was born.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As a 501(c)3 organization, NourishUnity exists to leverage the
              power of social media platforms and raise funds to alleviate
              hunger, homelessness, and unemployment.
              <br />NourishUnity will provide life-changing grants, assistance,
              and both monetary and non-monetary gifts to individuals and
              families. With your support, NourishUnity will change the world.
